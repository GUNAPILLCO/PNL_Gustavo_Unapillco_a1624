      "\t     \n",

      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \n",
      "is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \n",
      "the President has done this weekend is to consult really \n",
      "intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \n",
      "measures the United States could take in some of these areas to \n",
      "support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \n",

      "ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \n",
      "agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \n",
      "consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \n",
      "So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \n",
      "explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \n",
      "for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \n",
      "into that situation?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \n",
      "United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \n",
      "and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \n",
      "between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \n",
      "here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \n",
      "the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \n",
      "to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \n",
      "last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \n",
      "that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \n",
      "therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \n",
      "program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \n",
      "other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \n",
      "could promote American grain sales.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \n",
      "announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \n",
      "Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \n",
      "authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \n",
      "for a concessional loan program.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \n",
      "short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \n",
      "a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \n",
      "this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \n",
      "worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \n",
      "principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \n",
      "life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \n",
      "interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \n",
      "believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \n",
      "for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \n",
      "and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \n",
      "very important grain relationship, which is important for them, \n",
      "and it's important for the American farm community.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \n",
      "it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \n",
      "loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \n",
      "is that right? \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \n",
      "about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \n",
      "the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \n",
      "because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \n",
      "know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n",
      "$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \n",
      "taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \n",
      "market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \n",
      "respond to a specific request from the Russian government for \n",
      "major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \n",
      "grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \n",
      "we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \n",
      "great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \n",
      "the Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \n",
      "them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \n",
      "the short-term payments.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \n",
      "Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \n",
      "authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \n",
      "not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \n",
      "to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \n",
      "the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \n",
      "allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \n",
      "can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \n",
      "important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \n",
      "that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \n",
      "able to do so.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \n",
      "million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \n",
      "have a range from 0 to --\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \n",
      "for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \n",
      "that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \n",
      "harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \n",
      "shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \n",
      "harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \n",
      "same level of food imports from the West.\n",
      "\t     \n",

      "conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \n",
      "American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \n",
      "Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \n",
      "area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \n",

      "roughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \n",
      "Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \n",
      "will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \n",
      "summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \n",

      "productive and they're hard-hitting.\n",

      "like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \n",
      "convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \n",
      "support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \n",
      "Western governments have the financial resources over the next \n",

      "\t     \n",
      "\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \n",
      "wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \n",
      "on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \n",
      "the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \n",
      "last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \n",
      "Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \n",

      "\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \n",
      "deliver on making Russia a more --\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \n",
      "would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \n",
      "Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \n",
      "sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \n",

      "\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \n",
      "administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will \n",
      "the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \n",

      "\t     \t    \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \n",
      "about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \n",
      "program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \n",
      "through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \n",
      "that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \n",
      "the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \n",
      "Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \n",
      "account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \n",
      "months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \n",
      "these programs.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \n",
      "the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \n",
      "is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \n",
      "the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \n",

      "housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \n",
      "we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \n",
      "democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \n",

      "journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \n",
      "noticed.\n",
      "\t     \n",
      "\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \n",

      "administration took office and inherited some obligations that \n",

      "it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \n",

      "\t     \n",

      "has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \n",

      "have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \n",
      "itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \n",

      "- The language of the State is Turkish;\n",
      "- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\n",
      "  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\n",
      "- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\n",

      "\n",
      " A. Legislative Power:\n",
      "\n",
      " The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\n",
      " by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\n",
      " behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\n",

      " - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\n",
      " - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\n",

      " calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\n",
      " of twenty-one can vote.\n",

      " - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\n",
      "   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\n",
      "   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\n",
